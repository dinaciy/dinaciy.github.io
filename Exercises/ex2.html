        <p class="paragraph">Fantastic Mr. Fox is on the run! The three meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat Boggis, squat Bunce, and
            skinny Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox and his family surrounded. What they don't know is that
            they're not dealing with just any foxâ€“Mr. Fox would never surrender. But only the most fantastic plan ever can
            save him now.
